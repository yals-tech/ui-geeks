In this technique, JavaScript source code gets compiled into binary format, so that it can run quickly."},{id:3,question:i.createElement(i.Fragment,null,"JavaScript support multi-threading."),options:[{label:"true",id:1},{label:"false",id:2}],type:r.M.Radio,name:"intro_3",answer:2,explanation:"JavaScript has a single thread, which is used to execute the code. Because of this single thread, JavaScript is synchronous in nature."},{id:4,question:i.createElement(i.Fragment,null,"In JavaScript, functions are treated as first class citizens."),options:[{label:"true",id:1},{label:"false",id:2}],type:r.M.Radio,name:"intro_4",answer:1,explanation:"JavaScript treats functions as first class citizens. A programming language is said to have first-class functions, when functions are treated as other data types. For example: they can be stored in a variable, they can be passed as an argument to another function, can be extended, etc."},{id:5,question:i.createElement(i.Fragment,null,n.Fb," is one, in which operations which are normally done at compile time, can be done at run time."),options:[{label:"Imperative Language",id:1},{label:"Dynamic Language",id:2},{label:"Declarative Language",id:3},{label:"Object Oriented Language",id:4}],type:r.M.Radio,name:"intro_5",answer:2,explanation:"Dynamic language is one, in which operations which are normally done at compile time, can be done at run time.

In an interpreted language, the code is run from top to bottom and the result of running the code is immediately returned.
